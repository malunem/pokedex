## âœ¨ Deployed website

The website is publicly deployed on Gatsby Cloud at this address: https://pokedex71596.gatsbyjs.io/

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Run on localhost**

    All you have to do to have the project up and running on your machine is to run the following command on terminal. The only requirement is having Docker installed.

    ```shell
    git clone git@github.com:malunem/pokedex.git && cd pokedex && docker-compose up develop
    ```

    At the end, you will be promped to view the website at http://localhost:8000

    After the first run, you can restart it with:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up develop
    ```

2.  **Run tests**

    Navigate into the project root directory and run the command:

    ```shell
    npm test
    ```

    This will execute:

    - prettier (with pretty-quick) - to check style and indentation consistency
    - tsc (strict mode) - to verify that typescript compiles correctly
    - eslint (with AirBnb configs and some custom rules) - to ensure best practices and code quality
    - jest (with coverage report) - for unit tests on components
    - cypress (running headlessly) - for end to end tests on pages

    End to end tests could also be run with Cypress opened:

    ```bash
    npm run cy:open
    ```

    Please note that Cypress will report some accessibility issues checked with a11y: they are relative to ChakraUI Toast components and there is an [issue](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui/issues/7324) open on their repo.

3.  **Build for production**

    You can start a production build by running the following command. This will build the project for production after running all the tests, only if they pass.

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

4.  **Deploy**

    The project is automatically deployed when the `main` branch is updated.

## ðŸ“˜ About

The website is built with a mobile-first approach, with responsiveness for all devices. It uses `ChakraUI` components, that support accessibility.

Images are handled with lazy loading and a blurred version is showed during loading.

Internationalization is managed with `i18next` plugin for English, French and Italian.

It's possibile to search PokÃ©mons by name. Index and research engine are provided by the plugin `gatsby-plugin-flexsearch`. It is configured to allow searching by PokÃ©mon translated names (in French a lot of names are different).

All PokÃ©mon data is fetched at build time with REST APIs by the custom plugin `pokemon-plugin` which can be found in `/plugins/`.

All pages are created at build time. The project contains 200 PokÃ©mons.

If PokÃ©mon REST APIs return errors or there is some network issue, the plugin retries to fetch data recursively with increasing delay, to ensure the website is never built without data.
