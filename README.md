## âœ¨ Deployed website

The website is publicly deployed on Gatsby Cloud at this address: https://pokedex71596.gatsbyjs.io/

## ðŸš€ Quick start

Clone this repository and go to root directory:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:malunem/pokedex.git && cd pokedex
```

1.  **Run on localhost**

    All you have to do to have the project up and running on your machine is to run the following command on terminal. The only requirement is having Docker installed and running.

    ```shell
    docker compose up dev
    ```

    At the end, you will be prompted to view the website at http://localhost:8000

2.  **Run tests**

    
    Navigate into the project root directory and run the command:

    ```shell
    docker compose up test --build --attach-dependencies
    ```

    This will execute:

    - prettier (with pretty-quick) - to check style and indentation consistency
    - tsc (strict mode) - to verify that typescript compiles correctly
    - eslint (with AirBnb configs and some custom rules) - to ensure best practices and code quality
    - jest (with coverage report) - for unit tests on components
    - cypress (running headlessly) - for end to end tests on pages
      - gatsby develop will be runned as a dependency for cypress

    End to end tests could also be run with Cypress in browser:
    (this will also run the other tests)

    ```bash
    docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f cy-open.yml up test --build --attach-dependencies
    ```

    Please note that Cypress will report some accessibility issues checked with a11y: they are relative to ChakraUI Toast components and there is an [issue](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui/issues/7324) open on their repo.

3.  **Build for production**

    You can start a production build by running the following command. This will build the project for production after running the tests, only if they pass, and serve it on http://localhost:9000

    ```bash
    docker compose up prod --build
    ```

4.  **Deploy**

    The project is automatically deployed when the `main` branch is updated.

5.  **npm scripts**
  
  All the previous operations can be executed with `npm` outside Docker. Just be sure to use the right version of `npm`, by installing it globally or locally with `Volta` or `nvm`. 
  The npm version is pinned in package.json under `volta`.
  
  Here are the main scripts you can use after you have installed all dependencies with `npm ci`:
  
  - `npm run dev`: run gatsby develop on http://localhost:8000    
  - `npm run prod`: run gatsby build on http://localhost:9000
  - `npm run build`: run gatsby build headlessly
  - `npm run test`: run base tests (prettier, compiler, linter, unit tests)
  - `npm run cy:run`: run cypress headlessly
  - `npm run cy:open`: run cypress in browser
  
  There are other npm scripts used internally, such as `npm run pre-commit` which is used as pre-commit git hook by Husky if Docker is not available.

## ðŸ“˜ About

The website is built with a mobile-first approach, with responsiveness for all devices. It uses `ChakraUI` components, that support accessibility.

Images are handled with lazy loading and a blurred version is showed during loading.

Internationalization is managed with `i18next` plugin for English, French and Italian.

It's possibile to search PokÃ©mons by name. Index and research engine are provided by the plugin `gatsby-plugin-flexsearch`. It is configured to allow searching by PokÃ©mon translated names (in French a lot of names are different).

All PokÃ©mon data is fetched at build time with REST APIs by the custom plugin `pokemon-plugin` which can be found in `/plugins/`.

All pages are created at build time. The project contains 200 PokÃ©mons.

If PokÃ©mon REST APIs return errors or there is some network issue, the plugin retries to fetch data recursively with increasing delay, to ensure the website is never built without data.
